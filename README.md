# EV Dashboard USING REACT-JS

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an EV dashboard consisting of two components: a heat map chart and a sortable table. These components will visualize and display information about an electric vehicle (EV) fleet, including metrics such as kilometers traveled, carbon emissions, trip count, and other relevant statistics.

### Functionality
### Component 1: Heat Map Chart
1. Utilize a JSON structure to store EV fleet data, including metrics such as kilometers traveled, carbon emissions, and other relevant statistics.
2. Visualize fleet status over time through an interactive heat map chart.
3. Enable users to view trends and patterns in fleet performance.
4. Provide tooltips or data labels for detailed information on specific data points.

### Component 2: Sortable Table
1. Display detailed information about individual EVs in a tabular format.
2. Include columns for vehicle ID, trip count, kilometers traveled, and other relevant attributes.
3. Implement functions for sorting the table data based on various criteria such as vehicle ID, trip count, kilometers traveled, etc.
4. Support both ascending and descending order sorting to facilitate easy data analysis.
5. Enable users to quickly identify and analyze specific vehicles based on different parameters.
6. Provide search functionality to filter and find specific vehicles within the fleet.
